How to install the xmms output plugin for IRIX
==============================================

1) Get the source for xmms from http://www.xmms.org and unpack it under a
suitable directory, e.g. /usr/local/src. Then change to the xmms
directory, e.g. /usr/local/src/xmms-1.0.1

2) Get the source for the IRIX output plugin from
http://www.rzg.mpg.de/~mpd/xmms and unpack it. It will create a
subdirectory "xmms-1.0.1/Output/IRIX" under the current directory with all
necessary files. It will also replace the files "configure" and "Output/Makefile.in".

3) Run "configure", "make", "make install"

4) Start "xmms" and press "Ctrl-P". Select "Audio I/O Plugins" and
activate the IRIX plugin. That's all.



This has been tested with xmms-1.0.1 on an SGI Octane running IRIX 6.5.5m.


*********
Warning about the compiler: 'xmms' seems to have lots of 'gcc'
specific features.  If you try to compile with the SGI compiler 'cc'
you will have lots and lots of problems. If you want to save yourself
some trouble, use the GNU compiler 'gcc' instead. If you succeed
compiling 'xmms' with 'cc', please submit the changes to the 'xmms'
developer team at http://www.xmms.org.
